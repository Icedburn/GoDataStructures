# Go Data Structures

#### Description
Building some DataStructure as LinkedLists, SortedLists, Queues, Stacks, BinaryTrees, etc... Since Go doesn't have a generic type, I'm using the value variable as "string" since it can be read and converted to other types if needed. Another option is to adapt the library to other types.

##### Objective
Just study and maybe some reuse.
